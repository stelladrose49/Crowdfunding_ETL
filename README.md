# Crowdfunding_ETL

I successfully completed the following tasks in building a comprehensive campaign management system:

**Category DataFrame Creation (15 points):

I created a Category DataFrame with a "category_id" column containing entries with unique categories (5 points).
The DataFrame also includes a "category" column, exclusively containing category titles (5 points).
I successfully exported the Category DataFrame as category.csv (5 points).

**Subcategory DataFrame Creation (15 points):

I developed a Subcategory DataFrame with a "subcategory_id" column containing entries with unique subcategories (5 points).
The DataFrame includes a "subcategory" column, exclusively housing subcategory titles (5 points).
The Subcategory DataFrame was exported as subcategory.csv (5 points).

**Campaign DataFrame Creation (30 points):

I meticulously designed a Campaign DataFrame with various columns such as "cf_id," "contact_id," "company_name," "description," "goal," "pledged," "outcome," "backers_count," "country," "currency," "launch_date," "end_date," "category_id," and "subcategory_id" (25 points).
The "goal" and "pledged" columns were set as float data types for precision.
The DataFrame was exported as campaign.csv (5 points).

**Contacts DataFrame Creation (15 points):

I formulated a Contacts DataFrame with essential columns: "contact_id," "first_name," "last_name," and "email" (10 points).
The Contacts DataFrame was successfully exported as contacts.csv (5 points).
These completed tasks have laid the groundwork for a robust campaign management system, providing structured data for efficient analysis and utilization.
